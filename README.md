This is an example Maven project implementing an ImageJ 1.x plugin.

It is intended as an ideal starting point to develop new ImageJ 1.x plugins
in an IDE of your choice. You can even collaborate with developers using a
different IDE than you.

I will be using this as a basis for my final year project, Where I will 
create a plugin that will reconstruct & clarify images of cells taken from 
a monochrome image sensor.

To setup this software :
clone the repository

import as a maven project

edit the configuration to have "com.mycompany.imagej.Reconstruct" as the Main class

Use Java JDK V1.8

Run Reconstruct as main class
